Carbon Capture and Storage specific criteria covering technical (geological), geographical, economical and commercial considerations.

The ultimate intention is to support operators, and authorities alike, mature reliable CO2 storage resources, following the SPE SRMS system, but also ensure permanent containment through a multidisciplinary Containment Risk analysis, resulting in strictly risk-based Monitoring and Verification plans that meet International and Australian technical standards and requirements.

From experience on high-profile CCS projects in Europe, the author identified the missteps that can occur when petroleum professionals have attempted to quantify CO2 storage resources. Therefore, the App can be linked to a Python code that, with the relevant input, can adequately account for all dynamic aspects of CO2 injection into saline aquifers or depleted fields, which allows to estimate realistic CO2 storage resources for a particular notional development plan.

This tool underlines the importance to consider site specific transient effects in Pressures, caprock integrity, rock and fluid Compressibility, Temperature, CO2 density, stress regime, among others, over the static pore space analysis often used by petroleum professionals when CO2 storage resources are reported.
